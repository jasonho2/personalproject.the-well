    <p>
      Hello! I'm Jason (or your name), and I created The Well to build a space of warmth, connection, and healing.
      My journey has been one of faith, discovery, and learning to embrace both challenges and blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about community, spirituality, and helping others find peace and purpose in their lives.

    <h2>Outside of The Well</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not working on the community, you might find me hiking in nature, reading spiritual books, or experimenting with cooking.
