The Well is a community and support group for mothers with an overwhelming world of social media interference and raising children and a complex world.

The Well is targeted for new mothers to provide a safe and comforting environment.  This venture provides a wide range of social events, experiences, and hospitality to members who are all experiencing similar stresses of life with kids, as a way to escape the stressful world of being a new parent especially with younger children.
